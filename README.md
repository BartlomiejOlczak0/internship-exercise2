goodylabs internship exercise 2
===============================

Purpose of this document
------------------------

This excercise is to verify that you can:

1. create a simple web application
2. understand and work with MVC paradigm

List of tasks:
--------------

1. If you do not have a GitHub account yet, please go to [GitHub join page][github_join_page] and register. You will get a free account, no worries - no credit card is required. If you are lost, [this][git_github_account] might help ;) All initial information is also in the [First Internship Excercise][github_first_excercise].

2. Fork [this][this_repo] repository using any git client. If you do not know what forking, git or a repository is, please visit [this][git_getting_started] site and acquire some knowledge. A brief summary is also available [here][git_github_contributing_to_a_project].

3. Pick your favourite web framework (it can be PHP, Django, Python, Java with JSP, Ruby on Rails, express with node.js or any other framework) and create a simple form that will calculate an average car fuel consumption. It can calculate miles per gallon OR liters per every 100 kilometers - it is up to you.

Inputs (for European version): 
 * fuel (in liters)
 * journey driven (in kilometers)

Output:
 * an average fuel consumption (for example 6.8 l / 100 km)
 
Inputs (for US version): 
 * fuel (in gallons)
 * journey driven (in miles)

Output:
 * an average fuel consumption (for example 35 miles per gallon)
 
Please apply the rules of Model-View-Controller paradigm in your solution. 

4. Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages.

5. Push your changes from your local computer to your GitHub repository. If you do not know how to do it, please refer to [Git SCM page][git_working_with_remotes]. 

6. Send a pull request to goodylabs/internship-excercise2. This point is not mandatory, however it might speed up the verification process :) If you do not know how to do it, [this][git_github_contributing_to_a_project] might help here.

You're done ;)
